# Poopypants

This all started a long time ago.

http://www.poopypants.net/about

And now it's a full-fledged Ruby Gem!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'poopypants'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install poopypants
```

## Usage

It's really simple! Just create a new Poopypants object:

```ruby
name = Poopypants::Name.new("Eli", "Duke")
```

And then call `change` on it!

```ruby
name.change
=> Crusty Bubbletush
```

That's it!
